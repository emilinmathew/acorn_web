We are Team Purple - Emilin Mathew, Ana San Jose, and Nicholas Neoman. 
We had a great time taking Bio 46, learning the history of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (‘Ootchamin ‘Ooyakma),
and working together on this project! 

Special shoutout to Dr. Amanda Wu, Christopher Kirby, and the Biology Department at Stanford who helped make this
experience possible for us!
