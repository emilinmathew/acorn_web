## Overview
Acorn production across 2024 and 2025 demonstrated minimal correlations with tree size metrics, NDVI index, and regional grouping. Box plots of acorn count across groups showed no statistically significant differences between each tree's North and South regions, with all p-values exceeding 0.1. Analysis of tree size metrics, including DBH and crown diameters, revealed weak correlations with total acorn production, with R² values below 0.07 and p-values consistently above 0.3. Similarly, 3D regression analysis of acorn production against DBH and average crown diameter in 2024 and 2025 indicated weak explanatory power (R² = 0.073 and 0.07, respectively), emphasizing the limited predictive utility of these variables. Finally, the relationship between acorn production and the NDVI across 2024, 2025, and combined years also demonstrated minimal correlation, with low R² values (0.005 to 0.045) and high p-values (p > 0.4). 


## Relationship Between NDVI and Acorn Production
This analysis examines the relationship between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and acorn production across two years (2024 and 2025).
